\section{Significance of the Study}
The significance of this study lies in its main contribution to the field of requirements traceability, model-to-model decomposition, and model verification. Existing literature by Sulla and Malinao \cite{sulla-malinao} introduced a methodology for mapping RDLT to its equivalent Petri Net with considerations on the $L$ and $M$-attributes of the RDLT. However, the said literature was not able to capture the full functionality of an RBS as a Petri Net component. Hence, this paper aims to provide a novel method for mapping the reset and replenishment characteristics of RBS. The findings gained from the proposed mapping of this paper will not only shed light on the full mapping of RDLT to Petri Net but will also provide insight into the implications of mapping RDLT to Petri Net with respect to soundness. Additionally, this paper can be used as a reference for future RDLT and Petri Net research and applications.
