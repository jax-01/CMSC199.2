\section{Objectives of the Study}
    \subsection{General Objectives}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To formulate a mapping of RDLT to PN with consideration of the full functionality of reset-bound subsystems (RBS).
        \item To evaluate if such mapping of RDLT to PN in (1) results in an output PN that is classical sound.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Specific Objectives}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Identify components of PN or its variants/extensions that can be used to fully map the RBS in RDLT.
        \item Establish a mapping of the RBS in RDLT to PN component.
        \item Report the implications of RDLT mapping to PN with respect to the consistency of activities in the former to the cases derived in the latter.
        \item Report the space and time complexity of the proposed mapping.
        \item Report the implications of RBS mapping to PN soundness.
    \end{enumerate}
