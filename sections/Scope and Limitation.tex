\section{Scope and Limitation}
This study will focus on the improvement of the mapping methodology presented in the paper of Sulla and Malinao \cite{sulla-malinao}, to fully simulate the RBS of an RDLT in Petri net or its variants and extensions. Building upon their methodology, the proposed mapping of the RBS in this paper will also include pre-processing of the input RDLT producing the level-1 and level-2 vertex-simplified RDLT, defined in Definition 3, and the extended RDLT, defined in Definition 4. Meanwhile, selected Petri net variants and extensions that can simulate RDLT components, especially the reset and replenishment mechanism of RBS, will also be utilized. Possible implications of the full mapping of RBS to Petri Net soundness will also be covered in this paper.
